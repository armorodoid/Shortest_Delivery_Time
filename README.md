This project computes the shortest time and determines the most efficient path from pickup to delivery across multiple restaurants and customers.

**Approach:** The program identifies the closest pickup or delivery location relative to the delivery partner. Subsequently, it navigates to that location and repeats the process.

I've included numerous tests and recorded the timing of each pickup and delivery, ensuring they occur in the correct sequence.

I've also incorporated numerous comments within the code to enhance its readability.

This code is designed to function effectively with varying numbers of orders, restaurants, and customers.

I have included the output of the code in a file named **result.txt**, which provides a comprehensive overview of the optimal pickup and delivery sequence for each test case, aiming to minimize the overall time required.

This code is written in Java 17.
