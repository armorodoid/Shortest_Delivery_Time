This project calculates the shortest time and dictates the shortest path from pickup to delivery from multiple restaurants and customers.

I have added multiple tests and logged the time when each pickup and delivery are made in their correct order.

This code will work fine with multiple numbers of orders, restaurants and custumers.

This code is written in Java 17.
